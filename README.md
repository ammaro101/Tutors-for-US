This is a dynamic full stack web app I buildt using python, SQL, Flask, Django in 2020 as a final project for the CS50 course from HARVARD

This is a web application that allow 
students and tutors to reach each others, 
it will ask tutors to provide their 
information and GPS location, and will 
show students a list of cards, each 
card contains one tutor information, 
the website will ask user who is a 
student to provide his/her location and 
will show the cards of tutors whom are 
located within 10 KM from the user's location, 
so the student user won't bother himself/herself 
looking at all the registered tutors but only the 
ones who are nearby.
